# Property Pulse Website in Next.js from Scratch by Brad Traversy

This is from a class I took on Next.js https://www.traversymedia.com/nextjs-from-scratch

# Changes from Course

- Next.js 15
- Tailwindcss 4
- Used Postgres instead of Mongo

# Run Locally

Will eventually add a docker compose file but right now you can run it using.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
